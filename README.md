# My C++ Projects (0 to Hero)

Welcome to my **"0 to Hero"** C++ portfolio! 🚀  
This repository contains a series of projects that document my journey in learning C++ — from basic concepts to advanced applications. Each project is structured in its own folder, including relevant documentation and source code.

## 🌟 Overview

This repository is a collection of **100+ C++ projects**, covering a wide range of topics such as:

- ✅ **Fundamentals:** Variables, loops, functions, data structures  
- ✅ **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Classes, inheritance, polymorphism  
- ✅ **Algorithms & Data Structures:** Sorting, searching, trees, graphs  
- ✅ **Memory Management:** Pointers, smart pointers, dynamic allocation  
- ✅ **Multithreading & Concurrency:** Parallel processing, thread pools  
- ✅ **System Programming:** File handling, network communication  
- ✅ **Game Development & Graphics:** 2D/3D rendering, physics simulation  
- ✅ **Machine Learning & AI:** Neural networks, data analysis  
- ✅ **Project-Based Learning:** Real-world applications with increasing complexity  

The goal is to **"Learn by Doing"** — focusing on hands-on projects to master C++ concepts in an incremental and structured way.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each project is contained in a separate folder, numbered for easy tracking:

```
My_CPP_Projects//
├── 01_Hello_World/
│   ├── main.cpp
│   ├── README.md
│   └── ...
├── 02_Number_Guessing_Game/
│   ├── ...
│   └── ...
├── 03_Text_Based_Adventure_Game/
├── 04_...
├── .gitignore
├── README.md  <-- (this file)
└── ...
```

Within each project folder:
- `main.cpp` (or another appropriately named file) contains the main source code.
- `README.md` explains the project details (how to use, dependencies, etc.).
- Additional files (`Makefile`, headers, libraries, etc.) may be included as needed.
